# Japan-hostel-safety-heatmap

## Goal
THe goal of this project is to create a heatmap of hostels and earthquakes that were recorded in 2022 and to determine the safest and best rated hostel area from given data

## Dataset
I have posted hostel and earthquake excel sheets that I combined into Main excel sheet for better use in this project and here's the information on both ofhostel and earthquake datasets:

1. Japan Hostel Dataset from Kaggle, 2019, 342 rows and 16 features, excel

2. Earthquake In Japan from Kaggle, 2022, 37 rows and 22 features, excel

## Dashboard

Tableau dashboard can be found [HERE](https://prod-ca-a.online.tableau.com/#/site/karendavtyan2116f87da46f/workbooks/698023?:origin=card_share_link)



## Findings and Conclusions

+ Majority of top-rated hostels are in Osaka

+ Earthquakes don’t have a significance on ratings on hostels as there are no earthquakes near them

+ Majority of the earthquakes were tsunamis meaning it’s safer to get a hostel further away from a shore

## Future Goals

+ Getting a different safety metric data for a better understanding on hostel safety in Japan.

+ Group or solo traveler safety

+ Gender safety
